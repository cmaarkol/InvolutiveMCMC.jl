# InvolutiveMCMC.jl

Julia implementation of involutive MCMC.

## Overview

This package implements involutive MCMC in the Julia language, as described in
[Neklyudov et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16653.pdf).

Involutive MCMC "provides a unified view of many known MCMC algorithms, which facilitates the derivation of powerful extensions." (Neklyudov et al., 2020)
